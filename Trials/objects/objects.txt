Great news! You've been invited to help manage the World Cup statistics. Your task is to build an object that stores team and player statistics, 
and then create functions that can retrieve useful data.


Part 1: Building the Object
The first function you will define is called worldCupData. This function contains and returns an object nested in the following manner:

The top level of the object has two keys: "groupA", for teams in Group A, and "groupB", for teams in Group B.
The values of the "groupA" and "groupB" keys are objects that have:

"teamName" → A string representing the team name.
"colors" → An array of strings representing the team's colors.
"players" → An object where the keys are player names and the values are objects containing their stats:
Use the following data for your object
Group A

Team Name: Brazil
Colors: Yellow, Green
Players:
Neymar → (Goals: 5, Assists: 3, Yellow Cards: 1, Red Cards: 0, Minutes Played: 400)
Vinicius Jr → (Goals: 3, Assists: 4, Yellow Cards: 2, Red Cards: 0, Minutes Played: 380)
Casemiro → (Goals: 1, Assists: 1, Yellow Cards: 3, Red Cards: 1, Minutes Played: 450)
Group B

Team Name: Argentina
Colors: Light Blue, White
Players:
Messi → (Goals: 6, Assists: 5, Yellow Cards: 1, Red Cards: 0, Minutes Played: 480)
Di Maria → (Goals: 2, Assists: 3, Yellow Cards: 2, Red Cards: 0, Minutes Played: 390)
De Paul → (Goals: 0, Assists: 2, Yellow Cards: 4, Red Cards: 0, Minutes Played: 500)
To check your work, call console.log(worldCupData());

Part 2: Function Building
Now, build functions that operate on the object returned by worldCupData.

1. Find Goals Scored by a Player
Write a function goalsScored(playerName) that takes a player's name as an argument and returns the number of goals scored.

2. Find Minutes Played by a Player
Write a function minutesPlayed(playerName) that takes a player's name as an argument and returns their total minutes played.

3. Get Team Colors
Write a function teamColors(teamName) that takes a team name as an argument and returns an array of that team’s colors.

4. List All Team Names
Write a function teamNames() that returns an array of all the team names in the World Cup object.

5. Get Player Stats
Write a function playerStats(playerName) that takes a player's name as an argument and returns an object of that player’s statistics.

6. Most Goals Scored
Write a function mostGoalsScored() that finds and returns the name of the player with the highest number of goals.

7. Team with Most Goals
Write a function winningTeam() that finds the team with the most goals scored (sum of all players' goals) and returns its name.

8. Player with the Most Minutes Played
Write a function mostMinutesPlayed() that finds and returns the name of the player with the most minutes played.

Super Bonus
Write a function doesTopScorerHaveMostMinutes() that returns true if the player with the most goals also played the most minutes.
