# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
#                Poly = many
#                Morphe = Form

# ------------------------ Two Ways to achieve polymorphism ------------------------
# 1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
# 2. "Duck typing" = Object must have necessary attributes/methods

# -------------- Inheritance --------------------
